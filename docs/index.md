## Introduction
This work aims to analyse and display the different types of RPG turn-based combat.It will be analysed how it has evolved and the progress that different games have contributed to the genre.

## Differents kinds of turn-based combat system
### Classic Turn-Based Game
Each player can take as much time as they wish to decide and execute an action. Until the player decides, absolutely nothing in the game changes.

Example: [_Pokemon Emerald_](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald_Version) (2004)

## Timed Turns
Unlike the Classic, in this type of combat, each player has a limited period of time in which to perform an action. In this way limiting the game time and forcing the player to decide on an option.

Example: [_Ultima III:Exodus_](https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus) (1983)

## Active Time Battles
The turns played are determined by counters that reset each time an action is performed.

Example: [_Final Fantasy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV) (1991)

## Simultaneously executed Turns
It divides the turns into two distinct phases: decision and execution. During the decision phase, each player plans and determines the actions of his units.  Once in the execution phase, the decisions made by all players are put into action automatically and at the same time.

Example: [_Laser Squad Nemesis_](https://www.old-games.com/download/9175/laser-squad-nemesis) (2002)

## Clock-Based Turns
All the unit's actions are linked directly to the game's clock. The turns begin and end depending on the duration of each action, giving a highly variable sequence of turns in no particular order.

Example:[_Typhoon of Steel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_of_Steel_(video_game)) (1988)

## Unit Initiative
The sequence of turns in some games is determined by the initiative statistic of each unit, regardless of the side to which it belongs.

Example: [_Final Fantasy Tactics_](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics) (1997)
## Outside Turn
It allows players to perform an action outside their turn by interrupting their opponents' turns.

Example: [_X-COM_](https://xcom.com/es-ES/) (1993-1998)
## Special turns
This is when in combat it is necessary to follow different rules, for example not being allowed to use X attack or to use the same action twice in a row.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- It has a different system based on turn-based that players can choose a variety of games depending on their preference. For example, some people prefer playing classic turn-based games because they don't like playing in real time because they stress easily.
- The time you have in each turn allows you to make more tactical choices.
### Cons
- In terms of realism, the combat system can be considered unrealistic because of their mechanics. For example, in real life, people do not have specific time to attack or defend in a fight.
- It can be considered less immersive than other types of systems.
- In some cases, the mechanics and rules might be challenging for players to learn and understan

## Turn vs Real Time
There is debate as to which system is better between real-time and turn-based video games. The arguments in support of real-time systems solve some of the problems caused by turn-based systems.
To begin with, the lack of realism. The immersion that real-time based systems bring to the players makes them feel the actions and events that take place in the game as well as taking them into the [Magic Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_circle_(virtual_worlds)).
